                <p>Hello, my name is Lucas, and I am currently in the first semester of college studying Systems Analysis and Development. Now I'll tell you a bit about my journey. My story with programming began when I was 12 years old. As a child passionate about video games, my dream was to create an RPG game. During my research to achieve this dream, I discovered programming and started studying Python. Although it didn't yield many results initially, I created a question and answer game but didn't progress further. Years later, in high school, I discovered my true passion: web programming. From then on, I never abandoned programming. I started taking courses, did freelance work, and more recently, I enrolled in college for further academic development in the field. One day, I hope to become a software engineer.</p>
                <p>In web programming, I started my studies with HTML and CSS during a course I took in high school. I fell in love with front-end programming and dedicated myself to studying it for years. About two years ago, I began focusing on back-end and mobile programming, and now I am a full-stack developer (still learning).</p>
                <p>On this website, you will be able to learn a little more about me, my expertise in web programming, as well as outside of it. You'll find information about my projects and how to enter in contact with me.</p>
